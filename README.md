## Initial Enumeration

![Nmap Scan]

In this scan, we performed an Nmap scan on the IP address `10.10.196.19` with the following options:
- `-Pn` to skip the host discovery
- `-A` to enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute

The scan results show the open ports, services, and versions running on the target machine. It highlights common services such as HTTP and HTTPS running on Apache, along with details about the SSL certificate and HTTP server headers.

During the penetration test, we navigated to the `robots.txt` file to discover restricted directories and files. One of the interesting findings led us to the following key:

# gobuster

### License Page Discovery

Further exploration led us to a page with a message questioning our methods and hinting at additional encrypted content:

The page located at `http://10.10.196.19/license` contains a message along with a base64 encoded string, which could be a part of further challenge or information to decode.
